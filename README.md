## Requirements

- a Cloudflare account where you manage your domain with DNS records.

## Configure

zone-locator.py:
1. Get the Global API Key from Cloudflare 
2. fill your email and api key in zone-locator.py and your domain name 
3. Run zone-locator.py and you will get all DNS records for that domain

Take a note of ZONE ID and the DNS RECORD ID if you wanna update.

config.json:
